# GuestMode
This mod is designed to imitate old, pre-account-system Among Us</br>
It's only really useful when *testing a mod* on multiple instances of the game (since you don't have to worry about Steam popups getting in your way). Because it essentialy removes the account system, only playing on custom servers is possible.</br>
